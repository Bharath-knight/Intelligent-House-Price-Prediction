Built a Price Prediction model with ‘Light GBM’ algorithm for predicting the price of New York Airbnb. <br/>
• I learnt how to learn/extract infromation from raw, unstructured data. New York Airbnb listings Dataset from Kaggle was used in this repo to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.<br/>
• I have used the LinearRegressor, LightGBM models to make predictions of the house price. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was the performance metric used to compare the model. The model provided a Root Mean Square Error value - 0.459, showed better results than the Linear Regression model. <br/>
